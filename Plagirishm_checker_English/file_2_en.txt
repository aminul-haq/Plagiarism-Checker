Our cat was afraid to use the kitty door. we have a tendency to tried pushing her through, which caused her to be even additional afraid. The kitty door was dark, and he or she couldnâ€™t see what was on the opposite facet. the primary step we have a tendency to took in finding this drawback was tape recording the kitty door open. when a pair of days, she was with confidence returning and surfing the open door. However, after we removed the tape and closed the door, once again, she wouldn't undergo. they assert you catch additional bees with honey, thus we have a tendency to determined to use food as bait. we might sit next to the kitty door with a will of wet food and click on the highest of the will. once kitty came through the closed door, we might open the will and feed her. It took 5 days of doing this to create her unafraid of victimisation the kitty door. currently we've only one last problem; our kitty controls our lives!
